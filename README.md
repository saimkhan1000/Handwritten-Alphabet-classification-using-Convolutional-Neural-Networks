# Handwritten-Alphabet-classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks

This project is aimed to classify handwritten alphabets using a deep learning convolutional neural network. 

The database we will use is the NIST Special Database 19, which includes A-Z characters. This dataset actually covers 62 ASCII hexadecimal characters 
corresponding to the digits 0-9, capital letters A-Z, and lowercase letters a-z.

To make the dataset easier to use, Kaggle user Sachin Patel has released the dataset in an easy to use CSV file. 
This dataset takes the capital letters A-Z from NIST Special Database 19 and rescales them to be 28 x 28 grayscale pixels to be in the same format as our MNIST data.

For this project, we will be using just the Kaggle A-Z dataset, which will make our preprocessing a breeze. Link to the dataset is : https://www.kaggle.com/sachinpatel21/az-handwritten-alphabets-in-csv-format
